        <h2> How Hard Is Computer Science As A Major?</h2>

        Computer Science is extremely difficult. From labs, to tutorials to lectures (which are very hard to pay attention to by the way)
        I did 5 units of CAPE both years of sixth form and not even that compares to the work load I have right now.
        Luckily, the content tends to be interesting. Solving problems by writing code is a great feeling.
        Compiling your code and seeing "0 errors"????? AMAZING! 
        On the other hand, when I can't get my code to run I literally dream about coding, which isn't so great for my mental health.
        I have multiple mental breakdowns a week and the only thing that gets me through is the fact that if I quit it's going to take me longER
        to complete my degree.

         In addition to the Computer Science major stress, there is the stress of electives.
         I was trying Economics in my first year and it was going well; I got As in both courses BUTTTTT
         the second year lecturer confuses me and I'm now struggling with a subject that was so simple.
         Enter Web Dev. I'm trying new things in search of credits and a new minor since Econ clearly won't work.
         It's pretty simple so far but my issue is that the labs clash with the assignments I get from other courses,
         but I just have to work hard to get everything done. I am a professional student afterall.

        <h2>How to Balance Work and Play</h2>

        While school is important, I believe that it is also important to have fun. Whether it be eating out with friends,
        partying, going on a hike or even shutting down the computer and sleep! I try to do most of my work in the weekdays 
        so that my weekends are mainly mine. Being able to relax on a Saturday does more for my mental health than I realize.
        It isn't all the time that I get the chance to relax on a weekend though. This weekend in particular I have 3 huge assignents due,
        including this webpage!

        While I can't get an entire day to rest, it is pertinent that I allocate chunks of time to doing nothing. Just 
        to ensure I don't burnout. Sometimes I just drive out to a plaza and eat alone just to get my mind in a zone that
        will allow it to do good work. Even when I am workingI do things to keep me sane like call my friends on FaceTime or Discord.
        Music also helps but it's sometimes hard to focus while CardiB raps about violence.
        All in all, I have to find something to put ny mind at ease because if I keep spreading myself thin, I will keep producing mediocre work.
        Find a destress method that works for you!
