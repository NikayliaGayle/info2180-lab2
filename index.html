        <h2> How Hard Is Computer Science As A Major?</h2>

        Computer Science is extremely difficult. From labs, to tutorials to lectures (which are very hard to pay attention to by the way)
        I did 5 units of CAPE both years of sixth form and not even that compares to the work load I have right now.
        Luckily, the content tends to be interesting. Solving problems by writing code is a great feeling.
        Compiling your code and seeing "0 errors"????? AMAZING! 
        On the other hand, when I can't get my code to run I literally dream about coding, which isn't so great for my mental health.
        I have multiple mental breakdowns a week and the only thing that gets me through is the fact that if I quit it's going to take me longER
        to complete my degree.

         In addition to the Computer Science major stress, there is the stress of electives.
         I was trying Economics in my first year and it was going well; I got As in both courses BUTTTTT
         the second year lecturer confuses me and I'm now struggling with a subject that was so simple.
         Enter Web Dev. I'm trying new things in search of credits and a new minor since Econ clearly won't work.
         It's pretty simple so far but my issue is that the labs clash with the assignments I get from other courses,
         but I just have to work hard to get everything done. I am a professional student afterall.
